Description:
--------------
- Sadaham Sisila is a website where people who are interested in listening to Sinhalese dharma sermons/discussions from Sri Lanka's most popular Buddhist monks, can do so in one convenient place.
- The website features a MP3 player that users can use to listen to the dharma sermon with ease, as well as use play, pause, skip, fast forward or rewind functionalities.
- Since a majority of people in Sri Lanka do not have access to good internet or are using the internet off of data cards, I added a functionality into the MP3 player where the user can download the dharma sermon they are listening to, so that they can listen to it offline without worrying about running out of data.
Sadaham Sisila already has a vast library of dharma sermons from many popular Buddhist monks, however this library will be frequently be updated with new dharma sermons from even more Buddhist monks, to eventually create a large library of these sermons.
