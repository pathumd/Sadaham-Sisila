Description:
--------------
- Designed and developed a website called Sadaham Sisila (Buddhist Peace) using front-end development tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide users with a curated library of Sinhalese Buddhist sermons from Sri Lanka’s most famed monks.
- Buddhism is very dear to my heart because it fosters simplicity and utility, concepts that are valuable to my work and front-end designs in particular.
- To enhance user experience, I enabled offline listening for by implementing a feature-rich audio player using JavaScript. Finally, I also used Adobe XD to create an overall aesthetic that constitutes a tranquil space for listening.
